# About Me
{:.lead}

![me](/assets/img/about_me/me_square_427.jpg){: location='left' width="427" height="427" loading="lazy"}

My first name is Thomas, but most people call me by my middle name -- Andy. I'm currently a third-year PhD student supervised by Max Welling at the University of Amsterdam. My work is focused on probabilistic generative models, inspired by observations and theories from neuroscience. My current interests broadly include: developing unsupervised methods for learning approximately equivariant representations, exploring the computation benefits of topographically organized representations, and improving techniques for efficiently training deep latent variable models.

## Personal
Privately, I enjoy cooking (working on my [vegan tacos](https://www.instagram.com/tacosbygringos/)), running, and playing with my gymnastics rings. I was also an organizing member of the [Inclusive AI](https://uva-iai.github.io/) group at the UvA whose goal is to reduce harmful bias (both algorithmic and human) in the field of machine learning. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions!
